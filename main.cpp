    //Explaination: A dynamic number is a data form that consists of a smallest unit "a0" and a dynamic factor "u". the smallest unit represents the minimal quantifiable value, while the dynamic factor allows for variability and evolution of the number over time or operations wrt to the expansion of the spacetime's metric
